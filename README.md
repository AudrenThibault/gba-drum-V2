# gba-drum

This is a basic drum/pattern sequencer for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance. Compiled with devkit pro, using the libgba and maxmod libraries. Tested on visualboyadvance and no$gba & on actual gba with various flash cartridges.

What works:
-pattern sequencing & playback

-song/chain sequencing & playback

-in-program sample swapping

-song mode / live mode looping

-saving/loading

-pitch shifting of samples

-panning of samples

-volume of samples

-copy/paste patterns and orders

-random pattern generation
