A step sequencer for gba, using samples on the directsound channels. 

I wanted to make something closer to a drum machine than a complete 
'workstation' like lsdj. The main features i wanted was to have sync 
modes for connecting to other devices, and be able to arrange patterns 
into songs and chains like lsdj.

tested on visualboyadvance and no$gba & on gba with ez-flash II

what works:
-pattern sequencing & playback
-song/chain sequencing & playback
-in-program sample swapping
-song mode / live mode looping
-saving/loading
-pitch shifting of samples
-panning of samples
-volume of samples
-copy/paste patterns and orders
-random pattern generation

what needs to be done:
!-sync modes
!-more accurate bpm and shuffle handling
!-custom samples (gbfs / patching into binary like lsdj)

-improved graphics engine
-custoom sound engine    (atm using maxmod library)
-options for using the classic DMG sound channels to make noises
-sample effects (distortion, filtering, etc)
